## Project Summary
- **Abstract**:
The rise of CryptoPunks in June 2017 bring the innovation of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) in the field of art, which provokes a lot of discussion on the internet and social media. And in recent years, CryptoPunks' transactions have also received news and media attention because of its association with many social topics and ethical issues. In this paper, we apply Topic Analysis and Sentiment Analysis models to study the discussion topics of CryptoPunks and investigate people's attitude towards CryptoPunks on Twitter using Twitter data from 2017 to 2021. Moreover, this paper also utilizes the CryptoPunks transaction data from 2017 to 2021 with python, and applies Hedonic Regression models to explore the effects of gender and skin color on CryptoPunks price and return on investment. Finally, combining the data from the two analyses, this paper explores the correlation relationship between twitter sentiment and CryptoPunks price.
