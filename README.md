# On the Mechanics of NFT Valuation: AI Ethics and Social Media

## Project Summary
- **Abstract**:
The rise of CryptoPunks led to innovation in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the art field, and CryptoPunks' valuation mechanics has become a hot topic. However, the existing exploration of price prediction of CryptoPunks stopped in 2021 and only considered the impact of ethical factors such as gender and skin tone on price. Considering that 2021 was a booming year for the NFT market, the discussion on related social media grew dramatically. By applying sentiment analysis to social media data and using Hedonic regression for price prediction, this study is devoted to combining social media sentiment with ethical factors to examine the contribution of sentiment to CryptoPunks valuation. In addition,  the study compares the price prediction mechanisms before and after 2021 to explore structural changes in the NFT market. The findings suggest that social sentiment is a significant contributor to the price prediction of CryptoPunks, and there is a notable shift in the influence of ethical factors on their prices before and after 2021. Moreover, while peopleâ€™s attitudes towards CryptoPunks are generally positive, the findings reflect some gender and color imbalances.
