# 1. Introduction

With the development of block-chain technology, there are many creative art products created based on this technology. The CryptoPunk is one of the them. CryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel portraits generated by programming on block-chain and they were originally offered by Larva Labs since June 2017 [(Marcobello 2022)](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/cryptopunks-cryptocats-and-cryptokitties-how-they-started-and-how-theyre-going/.). Below is a figure including some Cryptopunks' image [("What Is CryptoPunk? Why Are They so Expensive? - Zipmex" 2022)](https://zipmex.com/learn/cryptopunk-explained/). Because the image of each Cryptopunk is unique, each Cryptopunk has a different price.

```{r figname, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Figure of some Female Cryptopunks' image", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./punks.png")
```

There are many factors that could influence the Cryptopunks' price, such as the utility of buying a punk and the rarity of a punk [(Ho et al. 2022)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9945566). However, the gender and skin tone type factors of the Cryptopunks' image have not yet been well studied. This project aims to better understand how the skin tone and gender of the CryptoPunck influence people's value of that CryptoPunks, and I use the market price of each CryptoPunks to reflect people's valuation of the CryptoPunks. More specifically, I am trying to answer the following questions:

1.  Differences between genders and Differences in skin tone: Are there significant differences in the price of Cryptopunks between the gender of the Cryptopunks? Are there significant differences in the price of Cryptopunks among different skin tones of the Cryptopunks?

2.  Differences within genders and Differences within: How does the price vary within each gender? For example, is the spread of price among the female larger than the spread of life price among the male? And how does the price vary within each skin tone type? For example, is the spread of price among the light skin tone larger than that of the dark skin tone?

In general, this project investigates whether factors such as gender and skin tone of the Cryptopunks are related to the people's valuation of that Punks, as measured by the market price. And how do these factors influence the price of the Cryptopunk.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 2.1 Data Summary and Transform

```{r}
cryptopunks <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunYutongAmber/SunYutongAmber/main/data/tx_db.csv")
glimpse(cryptopunks)
```

The data set contains 17826 rows and 13 columns, where each row corresponds to one observed cryptopunks, and each column represent an attribute of the cryptopunks. The data were scraped from blockchain transaction records of CryptoPunk token from Kaggle [(DUON 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/baotramduong/generate-nft-cryptopunks-with-dggan). The date of the data set ranges from the launch date of CryptoPunk, June 23, 2017, to July 27, 2022. It contains some important variables such as gender and skin tone of the cryptopunk image, which we will use in the analysis. It also contains a variable called "type", which tells us whether the image of the CryptoPunks is a human or not (it could be Zombie or animals). Since we are analyzing how skin tone and gender of the CryptoPunk influence people's value to that CryptoPunks, we only focus on human type and filter out other type.

And I find that in the original dataset, there are many cryptopunks have several different price in different time slot. I use average of these price, and then drop duplicated rows.

After that, I only keep the three columns we need, that is, average price, gender, skin tone. I also filter for NA to make this dataset neat.

```{r}
cryptopunks <- cryptopunks |>
  filter(type=="Human")|>
  group_by(punk_id) |>
  mutate(ave_price=mean(eth_price),
         gender_factor= as.factor(gender),
         skin_tone_factor=as.factor(skin_tone)) |>
  ungroup()
na.omit(cryptopunks)
```

```{r}
cryptopunks <- cryptopunks[!duplicated(cryptopunks$punk_id),]
cryptopunks
```

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected<-cryptopunks|>
  ungroup()|>
  select('punk_id','ave_price', 'gender_factor', 'skin_tone_factor')
cryptopunks_selected
```

The unit for the price of CryptoPunks is ETH, and 1 ETH is worth approximately 1212.26 US dollar for today (Nov 2022). The standard deviation of the CryptoPunks price is 41.55 ETH. And the mean for the price is 37.90 ETH.

```{r}
sd(cryptopunks_selected$ave_price)
```

```{r}
mean(cryptopunks_selected$ave_price)
```

```{r}
unique(cryptopunks_selected$skin_tone_factor)
```

I use skim to see the stats of the data. The `skim()` output reports summaries for categorical variables separately from the numerical variables. For the categorical variable, we could see from the table that the number of missing value is 0 and complete rate is 1 (because we have clean the dataset before), and the number of unique levels to gender and skin tone variables is 2(male, female) and 4(medium, light, dark, albino) respectively. And top_count column tells us there are 1937 cryptopunks in medium skin tone, 1893 in light skin, 1816 in dark skin, and 578 in albino skin. There are 4022 cryptopunks is male image, and 2202 in female image.

```{r}
skim_stats_table<-cryptopunks_selected %>% select(ave_price, gender_factor, skin_tone_factor) %>% skim()
skim_stats_table
```

## 2.2 Histogram of Cryptopunks Price Distribution by gender and skin tone.

And we could draw a histogram of the price of all these cryptopunks. We see that this data is *right-skewed*, also known as *positively* skewed: there are a few cryptopunks with very high price that are bringing up the mean price. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers; hence, the median is less than the mean in this case.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected,
       aes(x=ave_price)) +
geom_histogram(bins=50,
               color = "white",
               fill = "steelblue") +
scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 300)) +
labs(title = "Histogram of Price for CryptoPunks",
     x="Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH)",
     y="Counts")
```

To avoid the influence of large value, and in order to have a normal distribution of the residual plot after doing regression (I have checked that if do not transform the data, the distribution of residual is not approximate to normal), we use log transform for the price.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected,
       aes(x=ave_price)) +
geom_histogram(bins=30,
               color = "white",
               fill = "steelblue") +
#scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 300)) +
scale_x_log10() + 
labs(title = "Histogram of Price for CryptoPunks",
     x="Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH)",
     y="Counts")
```

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected <- cryptopunks_selected|>
  mutate(log_ave_price=log10(ave_price))
cryptopunks_selected
```

We group the data into different skin tone and gender respectively, and draw the distribution of price again.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected,
       aes(x=log_ave_price))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30,
                 color = "white",
                 fill = "steelblue") +
  #scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 300)) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Log_Price for CryptoPunks",
     x="Log Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH) by gender",
     y="Counts")+
  facet_wrap(~gender_factor)
```

Observe that the price distribution pattern seems similar in male and female group, while the number of cryptopunks in female image is obviously smaller than that of male.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected,
       aes(x=log_ave_price))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30,
                 color = "white",
                 fill = "steelblue") +
  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 300))+
  #scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 200))+
  labs(title = "Histogram of Log_Price for CryptoPunks",
     x="Log Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH) by Skin tone",
     y="Counts")+ 
  facet_wrap(~skin_tone_factor)
```

Observe that the number of cryptopunks in Albino skin tone is much lower than the other cryptopunks. On the other hand, the distribution pattern seems similar for the four types of skin tone.

Another important thing to do before we start regression is that I need to check the independence between the gender and skin tone variables so that I could decide whether to use the interaction regression model or the parallel regression model for section 3.2multiple regression. So I draw the price distribution by both gender and skin tone. From the graphs, we could see that The price distribution of Cryptopunks with different skin colors and gender combined is very similar to the price distribution plots of skin color and gender respectively. So we can assume that skin color and gender do not interact to affect Cryptopunk prices. A more rigorous way to check that the two variables are independent of each other would be to use the Chi-Square Test, but since it is not part of what is covered in class, I will not go over it here. Overall, we could assume that gender and skin tone's influence on price are not interact. So we could use a parallel regression model for section 3.2.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected,
       aes(x=log_ave_price))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30,
                 color = "white",
                 fill = "steelblue") +
  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 300))+
  #scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 200))+
  labs(title = "Histogram of Log_Price for CryptoPunks",
     x="Log Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH) by Skin tone and Gender",
     y="Counts")+ 
  facet_wrap(~skin_tone_factor+gender_factor)
```

## 2.3 Boxplot of Cryptopunks Price Distribution by gender and skin tone.

An alternative way to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable grouped by a categorical variable is using a side-by-side boxplot. I map the categorical variable gender and skin tone to the x-axis and the different price within each group on the y-axis.

Boxplot allows me to compare the median and variance of the distributions of a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable more directly. I can make quick comparisons between the categorical variable's levels with imaginary horizontal lines. I find that female cryptopunks have higher median price, and male cryptopunks' price is more varied distributed as indicated by their large interquartile ranges. And for skin tone, the medians for the four skin tone type are quite close, and the variances for the four type of skin tone are also similar.

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected, 
       aes(x = gender_factor, y = log_ave_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=gender_factor)) + 
  labs(title = "Boxlot of Log_Price for CryptoPunks by Gender",
     y="Log Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH)",
     x="Gender")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected, 
       aes(x = skin_tone_factor, y = log_ave_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=skin_tone_factor)) + 
  labs(title = "Boxlot of Price for CryptoPunks by Skin tone",
     y="Log Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH)",
     x="Skin tone")
```

In addition, from the boxplot, we could find there are some obvious outliers in data, we drop them. Now the boxplot looks like this:

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected_filtered <- cryptopunks_selected|>
  filter(log_ave_price>-2)
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected_filtered, 
       aes(x = skin_tone_factor, y = log_ave_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=skin_tone_factor)) + 
  labs(title = "Boxlot of Price for CryptoPunks by Skin tone",
     y="Average Price for CryptoPunks (ETH)",
     x="Skin tone")
```

I also compute the median and mean life expectancy for each continent with a little more data wrangling to check the conclusion from observation.

```{r}
cryptopunks_gender <- cryptopunks_selected %>%
  group_by(gender_factor) %>%
  summarize(median = median(ave_price), 
            mean = mean(ave_price),
            sd=sd(ave_price))
cryptopunks_gender
```

```{r}
cryptopunks_skintone <- cryptopunks_selected %>%
  group_by(skin_tone_factor) %>%
  summarize(median = median(ave_price), 
            mean = mean(ave_price),
            sd=sd(ave_price))
cryptopunks_skintone
```

## 2.4 Skin tone & Gender distribution in each other

I want to check how the skin tone type of Cryptopunks distributed by gender, and I also want to know the gender proportion for each skin tone.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected , aes(gender_factor, skin_tone_factor)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(fill=skin_tone_factor))+ 
  labs(title = "Bar plot of Skin tone distribution by Gender",
     x="Gender",
     y="Skin tone")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cryptopunks_selected , aes(skin_tone_factor,gender_factor)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(fill=gender_factor)) +
  labs(title = "Bar plot of Gender distribution by Skin tone",
     y="Gender",
     x="Skin tone")
```

From the above two graph, we could see that the distribution of skin tone type in male and female gender is quite similar (although the total number of Cryptopunks is different), and the proportion of male gender is about 50% for each skin tone type.

# 3. Data Modeling Analysis

## 3.1 Single Variable Regression

In this part I do the single variable linear regression for the analysis.

Firstly I use gender as Categorical explanatory X1 variable and transformed average cryptopunk price as Outcome variable Y. The Regression table tell us that $Y = 1.147 + 0.061*X1$. Because the Y data is log10 transformed from original price, so the coefficient means: an additive change in the X1 is associated with a multiplicative change in the dependent variable. That is, a unit change in X1 is associated with a $100*(10^{0.061} - 1) =15.08$ percent change in Y. Becuase all X I use are categorical variables, so it can only change from 0 to 1. That means when we change from male to female cryptopunks, the price will be expected to increase $0.1508*1.147=0.173$ ETH. Because p-value is less than 0.05, we could say that the difference between male and female Cryptopunks' price is statistically significant. And the intercept means the estimated expected price for Cryptopunks with dark skin tone is about $10^{1.147} = 14.03$ ETH.

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_gender <- lm(log_ave_price ~ gender_factor, data = cryptopunks_selected_filtered)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(regression_model_gender)
```

Next I use skin tone as Categorical explanatory X variables and transformed average Cryptopunks' price as Outcome variable Y. The Regression table tell us that $Y = 1.186 - 0.020*X_{Light} - 0.046*X_{Medium} + 0.028*X_{Albino}$. Because the Y data is log10 transformed from original price, so the coefficient means: an additive change in the X is associated with a multiplicative change in the dependent variable. For example, a unit change in X_Light is associated with a $100*(10^{-0.02} - 1) = -4.501$ percent change in Y. Because X is dummy variable, that means when changing X_Light from 0 to 1, there will be about 0.04501\*1.186= 0.053 ETH decrease. However, the p-value is larger than 0.05, we could say that the difference between dark and light Cryptopunks' price is not statistically significant. And the intercept means the estimated expected price for Cryptopunks with dark skin tone is about $10^{1.186} = 15.35$ ETH.

```{r}
100*(10**(-0.02) - 1)
-0.04501*1.186
10**1.186
```

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_skin <- lm(log_ave_price ~ skin_tone_factor, data = cryptopunks_selected_filtered)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(regression_model_skin)
```

## 3.1.1 Gender Logistic Regression

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected_filtered
```

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected_filtered['gender']<-ifelse(cryptopunks_selected_filtered['gender_factor']=='Male',0,1)
cryptopunks_selected_filtered['gender']
```

```{r}
cryptopunks_selected_filtered['skin']<-ifelse(cryptopunks_selected_filtered['skin_tone_factor']=='Dark',0,1)
cryptopunks_selected_filtered['skin']
```

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_gender <- lm(log_ave_price ~ skin, data = cryptopunks_selected_filtered)
# Get regression table:
#get_regression_table(regression_model_skin)
print(summary(regression_model_gender))
```

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_skin <- glm(log_ave_price ~ skin_tone_factor, data = cryptopunks_selected_filtered,family = binomial)
# Get regression table:
#get_regression_table(regression_model_skin)
print(summary(regression_model_skin))
```

## 3.2 Multiple Varibles Regression

I use both skin tone and gender as Categorical explanatory X variables and transformed average cryptopunk price as Outcome variable Y. According to the exploratory data analysis from section2, we have that skin tone is almost independent with gender variable, so according to *`Occam's Razor principle`* [(McConville, n.d.)](https://moderndive.com/6-multiple-regression.html#model-selection.), we use the parallel regression model for simplicity and we don't need to consider the interaction between gender and skin tone factor. The regression function is $Y= 1.164+0.061*X_{female} - 0.019*X_{Light} - 0.047*X_{Medium} + 0.028*X_{Albino}$. Here the base level for the regression is Dark skin and male Cryptopunk. So the estimitaed intercept means the expected price of Cryptopunk in Dark skin and male gender is about $10^{1.164}$ ETH. And for the coefficients, because the Y data is log10 transformed from original price, so the coefficient means: an additive change in the X is associated with a multiplicative change in the dependent variable. And all X variables are dummy variables, so we only could change the value of X from 0 to 1. For example, the coefficient -0.047 (coefficient of $X_{Medium}$ ) indicates that when changing from Cryptopunks in male gender and Dark skin tone from Cryptopunks in male gender and medium skin tone, the expected price will decrease $100*(10^{0.047} - 1)$ percent. Similarly, when changing from Cryptopunks in male gender and Dark skin tone from Cryptopunks in male gender and light skin tone, the expected price will decrease $100*(10^{0.019} - 1)$ percent. This result can be explained as many famous basketball sport starts are male in dark skin tone, and the Cryptopunks of their images have high value in the Cryptopunk market. And if the p-value is less than 0.05, then that price of combination of gender or skin tone type difference is statistically different from the base level. More about the p-value and confidence interval will be discussed in section 3.3.

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_combined <- lm(log_ave_price ~ gender_factor + skin_tone_factor, data = cryptopunks_selected_filtered)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(regression_model_combined)
eth_price
```

## HCI-With all price(not average price)

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_combined <- lm(eth_price ~ gender + skin_tone, data = cryptopunks)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(regression_model_combined)
print(summary(regression_model_combined))
```

## HCI-ROI Regression

```{r}
#ROI data calculation
cryptopunks <- read_csv("tx_db.csv")
cryptopunks
```

```{r}
cryptopunks<-cryptopunks|>
  group_by(punk_id)|>
  mutate(ROI = (eth_price/lead(eth_price) - 1) * 100)|>
  filter(ROI<100000)
cryptopunks<-na.omit(cryptopunks)
cryptopunks
```

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
regression_model_combined <- lm(ROI ~ gender + skin_tone, data = cryptopunks)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(regression_model_combined)
print(summary(regression_model_combined))
```

## 3.3 Inference for Multiple Regression

I will do Hypothesis testing to the multiple regression. From the result of the regression table above, I'll test two different null hypotheses.

The first null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between gender of the Cryptopunk image and the Cryptopunk price. That is, $H_0:\beta_{female} =0$. However, according to the regression table of the multiple regression, $\beta_{female} =0.061$. Furthermore, this relationship seems to be reasonable because the 95% confidence interval for the gender coefficient is (0.018, 0.104), which is entirely on the positive side and does not include 0. In addition, the p-value 0.005 is less than 0.05 and is very small, so I could reject the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative $H_A:\beta_{female} \not= 0$ and it is positive.

The second set of null hypotheses that we are testing are that there is no relationship between skin tone type of the Cryptopunk image and the Cryptopunk price. That is, $H_0:\beta_{light} =0$, $H_0:\beta_{medium} =0$,$H_0:\beta_{albino} =0$. I will take the light skin tone variable as an example. According to the regression table of the multiple regression, $\beta_{light} =-0.019$. However, this value is not statistically different from 0 because, firstly, the 95% confidence interval is (-0.072, 0.034), which cover 0 value. In addition, the p-value is 0.488, which is larger than 0.05. So I could not reject the null hypothesis. Similarly for the medium skin and albino skin variable, so it appears the price differences of Cryptopunks in different skin tone type are not meaningfully different. This result is consistent with our observations from the visualization of the distribution in section2.

And for the confidence interval, I use the one generated by `get_regression_table` function rather than generating it using Bootstrapping. Because, although Bootstrapping is able to increase the accuracy of the estimation of the confidence interval of small dataset, for this large dataset, the confidence interval generated from Bootstrapping method does not different from the one generated by `get_regression_table` function that much.

## 3.4 Residual

## 3.4.1 Residual Table

The residual column in the above table is derived from the predicted value (**log_ave_price_hat)** minus the original value (**log_ave_price)**. The predicted value is calculated from the regression function. The residual distribution could be used to check whether our prediction is accurate. If the residual value is random distributed around 0, and the distribution is approximate to normal distribution, then in general the prediction model is good.

Below are the three residual tables for regression model consider gender as explanatory variable, regression model consider skin tone type as explanatory variable, and regression model consider both skin tone type and gender as explanatory variables respectively.

```{r}
regression_points_gender <- get_regression_points(regression_model_gender, ID="punk_id")
regression_points_gender
```

```{r}
regression_points_skin <- get_regression_points(regression_model_skin, ID="punk_id")
regression_points_skin
```

```{r}
regression_points_combined <- get_regression_points(regression_model_combined, ID="punk_id")
regression_points_combined
```

## 3.4.2 Residual Box Plot

Below are the three residual box plots for regression model consider gender as explanatory variable, regression model consider skin tone type as explanatory variable, and regression model consider both skin tone type and gender as explanatory variables respectively.

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_gender, aes(x = gender_factor, y = residual)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=gender_factor)) +
  labs(x = "gender", 
       y = "Residual",
       title = "Boxplot of Residual")
```

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_skin, aes(x = skin_tone_factor, y = residual)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=skin_tone_factor)) +
  labs(x = "Skin tone type", 
       y = "Residual",
       title = "Boxplot of Residual")
```

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_combined, aes(x = log_ave_price_hat, y = residual)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Predicted Value", 
       y = "Residual",
       title = "Boxplot of Residual")
```

From the above three box plots, we could see that there are not any systematic patterns to either of the scatter plots and residual is randomly distributed above and below 0, which is good because the residual are supposed to be random.

## 3.4.3 Residual Histogram Plot

Below are the three residual histogram plot for regression model consider gender as explanatory variable, regression model consider skin tone type as explanatory variable, and regression model consider both skin tone type and gender as explanatory variables respectively.

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_gender, aes(x=residual)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Residual", 
       y = "Count",
       title = "Histogram of Residual")
```

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_skin, aes(x=residual)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Residual", 
       y = "Count",
       title = "Histogram of Residual")
```

```{r}
ggplot(regression_points_combined, aes(x=residual)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Residual", 
       y = "Count",
       title = "Histogram of Residual")
```

The residual is bi-normal because all the explanatory variables are categorical so this make sense (graphs could be further polishes, add history line to histogram, add color to boxplot).

# 4. Conclusions and Discussions

## 4.1 Conclusions

According to the results from single variable regression, I find that there is a significant difference in gender for Cryptopuncks' price. Female images of Cryptopunk tend to have a higher price than that of males. In general, the expected Cryptopunk price increase by 0.173 ETH on average when changing from male to female (keep other variables unchanged). However, this does not necessarily mean that gender of the female Cryptopunk image *causes* a higher price (because we cannot get causal inference from the regression), and this only means they are associated. In addition, I find that the Cryptopunks' price is not statistically different for different skin tone types. These conclusions hold for multiple regression as well.

Overall, these results suggest that the gender of Cryptopunks' image is a factor of Cryptopunks' price. These findings are consistent with the data visualization in section 2. From the histogram in section 2, I have found that the number of Cryptopunk in the female image is obviously smaller than that of the male image. And I believe this could explain why female Cryptopunk has a slightly higher price, since the rarer the quantity, the higher the price of the Cryptopunk. Because CryptoPunks are programmed to be combined into a relatively fixed amount of each type and property [(Mekacher et al. 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17922-5). Therefore the scarcity of these female Cryptopunks will not change in a short time. According to this analysis, I believe people who invest in the Cryptopunks market should consider buying female images with whatever skin tone type.

## 4.2 Limitations and Future Research

The first limitation of this study is that the linear regression model is not the most suitable model for the situation when all explanatory variables are categorical. In this case, I should use Logistic Regression instead. So in the future, I will try to apply Logistic Regression to explain how categorical variables like gender and skin tone influence the Cryptopunks' price more accurately. The second limitation of this study is that we do not consider other important factors that could potentially influence the Cryptopunk price, like the market news' influence on price, in future studies this problem should be solved. Another limitation is the data set. The Cryptopunk data set I am using is directly drawn from Kaggle, which only contains cryptopunks' price data from the launch date of CryptoPunk, June 23, 2017, to July 27, 2022. This data set cannot be updated automatically. In the future, I plan to use the API of the Cryptopunks transaction market directly so that the data set could be up to date.
